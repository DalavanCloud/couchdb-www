All source tarballs and release binaries are signed with one of these GPG keys: https://www.apache.org/dist/couchdb/KEYS

You can verify a release by importing the key file and running:

    gpg --import KEYS
    gpg --verify /path/to/downloaded/file.asc

In addition, we produce hashes for the download files with sha256 and sha512. You can validate those hashes:

    shasum -n 256 /path/to/downloaded/file.sha256
    shasum -n 512 /path/to/downloaded/file.sha512
